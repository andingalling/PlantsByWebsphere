				<h2>
					<a name="Overview">Overview</a>
				</h2>
				<p>Plants by WebSphere is an Internet storefront application that
					specializes in the sale of plants and gardening tools. Using the
					Plants by WebSphere store front, customers can open accounts,
					browse for items to purchase, view product details, and place
					orders.</p>
				<p>This sample is designed using a typical Java EE web
					Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The MVC pattern provides
					separation of concerns for persistent data, presentation of
					information, and the control logic that is used to tie them
					together. The sample has been updated to utilize the following
					technologies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For the presentation tier, Plants By WebSphere uses a
						combination of JSF 2.0 and Facelets.</li>
					<li>The controllers are a combination of Managed Beans and EJB
						session beans.</li>
					<li>The model portion is generally handled by JPA, though some
						presentation side wrapping is done to provide additional
						presentation support. A Derby database provides persistence for a
						catalog, inventory of items, order handling, as well as a simple
						user registry.</li>
					<li>All of the above is tied together using CDI.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One interesting point to note is that now it is no longer
					necessary to physically separate all these things into different
					modules. You can create controllers as Managed Beans and package
					them in your WAR files and as your needs grow to include
					transactions and security, you can add EJB annotations to those
					Managed Beans and still access them directly from JSF without
					having to repackage your application or refactor your code.</p>
				
				<h2>
					<a name="Getting_Started" class="sampnav">Getting started</a>
				</h2>

				<p>
					It is recommended that you copy the
					<samp>
						<var>install_root</var>/samples
					</samp>
					directory to your own work area and use it for any samples
					development. This will prevent any changes you are making to the
					samples from being overwritten when service updates are applied.
					Any references to directory locations used in this document will
					use the installed sample location for clarity only.
				</p>

				<p>
					<img src="images/takeNote.gif"
						width="13" height="13" border="0" alt="Important Information">
					&nbsp;The instructions assume the application will be built on a
					Linux system. Small variations in the commands may exist on Windows
					systems.
				</p>

				
				<h2>
					<a name="Development_and_Build">Development and Build</a>
				</h2>
				<p>The sample comes with a pre-built version of the Plants By
					WebSphere application, which can be found in the following
					directory:</p>
				<p>
					<samp>
						<samp>
							<var>install_root</var>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere/pbw-ear/target
						</samp>
					</samp>
				</p>
				<p>If you want to jump ahead and try it out, see the <a
				href="#Application_Install">Application Install</a> section.</p>
				<p>
					The sample was developed using Rational Application Developer
					(RAD), but the build environment has been setup to use <a
						href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>. The sample can
					be used for further develop and test either as is or imported into a set of projects in Rational
					Application Developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to use both RAD and Maven together, you should obtain
					and read the <a
						href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/download/attachments/113607155/RAD_755_MAVEN_0601.pdf?version=1">Java
						EE Development using Rational Application Developer 7.5.5 and
						Maven</a> white paper. The rest of this document will assume the
					exclusive use of Maven as a build environment and a basic text
					editor for changing files.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<a name="Identifying_the_directory_structure" class="sampnav">Identifying
						the directory structure</a>
				</h3>
				<p>The directory structure of the sample follows the guidlines
					for building Java EE applications using Maven:</p> <br>

				<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td class="sampnav"><samp>
									<var>install_root</var>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere
								</samp></td>
							<td class="sampnav">Contains the Sample source code for the
								Plants by WebSphere sample and is organized as a heirarchy of
								Maven projects. Source is generally found in the <samp>src</samp>
								subdirectory of each Maven project.</td>

						<tr>
							<td class="sampnav"><samp>
									<var>install_root</var>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere/target/site/apidocs
								</samp></td>
							<td class="sampnav">Contains the Javadoc documentation for
								the sample. This directory is created during the Plants by
								WebSphere sample maven build.</td>

									<var>install_root</var>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere/.../target
								</samp></td>
							<td class="sampnav">The target directory contains the build
								generated files. Each maven sub-project will build a portion of
								the sample, typically a module. The pbw-ear project assembles
								the modules and builds an EAR file. The parent project provides

						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
				<p>
					You will need to obtain and install Maven 2.2 or later prior to
					building the sample. See <a
						href="http://maven.apache.org/index.html">http://maven.apache.org/index.html</a>
					for more information about Maven.
				</p><h4>Using Java 7</h4>
				<p>By default, Java 6 will be used to build and run
					applications. To utitilize Java 7 for building and running the
					application, setup the profile and Maven to use Java 7. This requires prior
					installation of the Java 7 extension for WebSphere. The following
					command may be used to determine what choices are available for SDK
					selection:</p>
				<p>
					<samp>
						<i>install_root</i>/bin/managesdk -listAvailable
					</samp>
				</p><p>Use the appropriate Java version and bit architecture for your system when selecting the Java SDK to use.</p>
				<p>
					There are two ways to enable a profile to utilize Java 7. Typically a profile will already exist. The following example commands describe how
					to enable the AppSrv01 profile to use 32 bit Java 7 (add
					<samp>
						-user <i>name</i></samp>
					and
					<samp>
						-password <i>text</i></samp>
					parameters if the profile has admin security
					enabled):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><samp>managesdk -enableProfile -sdkName 1.7_32
							-profileName AppSrv01 -enableServers</samp>
					</li><li><samp>managesdk -setCommandDefault -sdkName 1.7_32</samp>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If
					no profile exists yet, run the following before creating the
					profile:</p>
				<ul><li><samp>managedsdk -setNewProfileDefault -sdkName
							1.7_32</samp>
					</li><li><samp>managesdk -setCommandDefault -sdkName 1.7_32</samp>
					</li>
				</ul><p>
					Edit the
					<samp>
						<i>install_root</i>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere/pom.xml
					</samp>
					file and set the
					<samp>&lt;source&gt;</samp>
					and
					<samp>&lt;target&gt;</samp>
					values to 1.7.
				</p><h4>Environment setup</h4>
				<p>
					The POM files for the Plants by WebSphere project assume several
					things:<br>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <samp>WAS_HOME</samp> environment variable has been
						set to the install location of the WebSphere Application Server.</li><li>The <samp>JAVA_HOME</samp>
						environment variable has been
						set to the install location of the preferred Java SDK.</li>
					<li>The Java EE API jar has been added to a local maven
						repository for use during the maven build.</li>
				</ul> 
				<p>Set <samp>WAS_HOME</samp> and
					<samp>JAVA_HOME</samp>
					by executing <samp>
					<i>install_root</i>/bin/setupCmdLine</samp>. Be sure to add the Java SDK
					<samp>bin</samp>
					directory to the
					<samp>PATH</samp>
					as well.</p>
				<p>Lastly, add the Java EE API jar to the local
				maven repository by running the following command (be sure the Maven
					<samp>bin</samp>
					directory is on your
					<samp>PATH</samp>
					):</p>
				
					<samp>mvn install:install-file
						-Dfile=$WAS_HOME/dev/JavaEE/j2ee.jar -DgroupId=com.ibm.websphere
						-DartifactId=java-ee-apis -Dversion=6.0 -Dpackaging=jar
						-DgeneratePom=true</samp>
				


				<h3>
					<a name="Building_the_sample" class="sampnav">Building the
						sample</a>
				</h3>

				<p>
					To rebuild this sample, verify that
					<samp>
						<i>profile_root</i>/bin
					</samp>
					is in your PATH environment variable. Follow these steps to rebuild
					the sample:<br>
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>At the command line, change to the <samp>
							<var>install_root</var>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere
						</samp> directory.</li>
					<li>Run maven:</li>

					
						<samp>mvn install site</samp>
					

				</ol>
				<p>
					<br>This will compile the Java code, package the modules,
					package the ear, and create the Javadoc. The ear file will be located in the
					<samp>pbw-ear/target</samp>
					directory and the Javadoc will be located in the
					<samp>
						<var> </var>
						target/site/apidocs
					</samp>
					directory.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<a name="execute" class="sampnav"> </a>

				<h2>
					<a name="Application_Install">Application Install and
						Management</a>
				</h2>
				<p>WebSphere provides multiple ways to install an application.
					In addition to the typical console and scripting styles, a new
					style focused on supporting application development with batch
					build environments has been added called monitored directory
					deployment. This document will focus on that style of deployment.</p>
				<p>Monitored directory deployment allows a developer to install
					an application on an application server and start it
					simply by copying  the application to a directory. The application is uninstalled
					by removing the file from the monitored directory.</p>
				<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
				<p>
					There are three aspects that must be addressed when using monitored
					directory deployment:<br>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ensuring that necessary resources are available</li>
					<li>ensuring that necessary resources are configured</li>
					<li>enabling the monitored directory deployment service</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<br>The Plants By WebSphere sample uses a Derby database,
					which must be setup before running the application. The application
					assumes the Derby database will be installed in
					<samp>
						<i>install_root</i>/Derby/databases.
					</samp>
					Use the following commands to setup the Derby database before
					installing and running the Plants by WebSphere sample application:
				
				<div id="Win_011" style="display: block">
					<dl>
						<dd>
							<samp>
								cd <i>install_root</i>/Derby/databases
							</samp>
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<samp>jar xf ../../samples/PlantsByWebSphere/Derby/PLANTSDB/pbw-db.jar</samp>
						</dd>
					</dl>
				</div><p>On systems where the person installing the Derby database and the person using the sample are not the same, some adjustment of the permissions of the extracted files may need to be made. Make sure the appropriate read and write permissions are set by either changing the owner of the files or setting group read and write permissions.</p><p>The
					Plants By WebSphere sample uses an enhanced EAR to capture the
					deployment configuration information for the EAR. This information
					creates the resources required by the application to access the
					Derby database as well as a resource for a mail provider. The mail
					provider resource is a dummy mail provider that will attempt to
					send mail to a fictitous SMTP server.</p>
				<p>
					The enhanced EAR data was configured using RAD and saved as part of
					the EAR file metadata in the
					<samp>pbw-ear</samp>
					sub-project. If you want to change the location of the Derby
					database, you will also need to update the resource configuration
					within the enhanced EAR metadata and rebuild the sample.
				</p>
				<p>
				<p>Applications may be installed in WebSphere by copying the EAR
					file to a well known location and can be uninstalled by removing
					the EAR file from that location. However, this is not turned on by
					default. Monitoring may be turned on by using the following
					command:</p>
				<p></p>
				<ol>
					<li>In the Integrated Solutions Console, click <strong>Applications
							&gt; Global deployment settings</strong>.</li>
					<li>Click the check box to Monitor directory to automatically
						deploy applications. Note: remember the directory location used
						here.</li>
					<li>Apply the settings, Save your changes, and restart the
						server.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Once this is complete, the Plants by WebSphere application
					may be installed by copying it to the directory location specified
					in the Global deployment settings panel.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/takeNote.gif"
						width="13" height="13" border="0" alt="Important Information">
					&nbsp;The monitored directory location listed in the console is
					only the root of a collection of monitored directories. Each server
					will have a unique sub-directory location that is used under that
					root directory.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<h3>
					<a name="3" class="sampnav">Installing the Plants by WebSphere
						sample application</a>
				</h3>
				<p>The Plants by WebSphere application may be installed by
					copying it to the directory location specified in the Global
					deployment settings panel. The following example assumes typical
					profile and server names, but may need to be modified for your
					particular case:</p>
				<div id="Win_012" style="display: block">
					<dl>
						<dd>
							<samp>
								cd <i>install_root</i>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere/pbw-ear
							</samp>
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<samp>
								cp target/pbw-ear.ear <i>install_root</i>/profiles/<i>AppSrv01</i>/monitoredDeployableApps/servers/<i>server1</i>
							</samp>
						</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
				<p>To uninstall the Plants by WebSphere application, just delete
					the EAR file from the monitored directory location.</p>
				<p>A developer will typically keep an eye on the log file to
					understand when application deployment has completed and watch for
					errors. If you are not using an IDE, such as RAD, that monitors the
					log, you can use:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<samp>
							tail -f <i>install_root</i>/profiles/<i>AppSrv01</i>/logs/<i>server1</i>/SystemOut.log
						</samp>
					</dt>
				</dl>
				<p>When the application install completes, a log message that is
					similar to the following should be visible:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<samp>[2/5/11 8:59:28:765 CST] 0000001c AppManagement I
							CWLDD0021I: Event id 1794713772-1. Application pbw-ear is started
							on:
							WebSphere:cell=stutzNode01Cell,node=stutzNode01,server=server1,status=success.</samp>
					</dt>
				</dl>
				<p>
				<h3>
					<a name="2" class="sampnav">Configuring mail resources
						(optional)</a>
				</h3>

				<p>The Plants by WebSphere application makes extensive use of
					annotations for describing metdata about application requirements.
					While this, in general, can improve developer productivity, it can
					have some drawbacks. Components that use resource injection require
					that the resource be defined and references bound to it in order to
					resolve injection during component startup. This is true, even if
					the component may not use the resource in a scenario. For example,
					if a developer is working on updating the UI page flows, they
					probably don't care exercise the logic for sending an email message
					for order processing. However, the injected resource chain
					(ShoppingServlet &gt; MailerBean &gt; mail Session) would require
					that a mail provider be configured.</p>
				<p>
					A fictitous mail provider for the Plants by WebSphere Sample has
					already been included in the enhanced EAR. If you do not want to
					send an order confirmation e-mail, skip this section. The following
					steps describe how to update the enhanced
					EAR's mail resource:<br>
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Edit the file <samp><i>install_root</i>/samples/PlantsByWebSphere/pbw-ear/src/main/application/META-INF/ibmconfig/cells/defaultCell/applications/defaultApp/deployments/defaultApp/resources.xml</samp></li><li>Find the text <samp>mailTransportHost=&quot;somehost.com&quot;</samp>
						and change it to a valid SMTP server host.</li><li>Rebuild the application as described above</li>
				</ol><h2>
					<a name="Run_the_Application">Run the Application</a>
				</h2>
				<p>To run the application, click the following link:<br/>
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<samp><samp>
								<a
									href="&lt;samp&gt;&lt;samp&gt;http://localhost:9080/PlantsByWebSphere&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;">http://localhost:9080/PlantsByWebSphere</a>
							</samp></samp>
						</dt>
					</dl>
				<p>Note the link assumes that the application has been installed on a
					local server with the typical HTTP port and the WebSphere
					environment has been appropriately configured. If your installation
					is not local or does not use the default HTTP ports, you will need
					to update the URL accordingly.</p>
